# ranking engine

ideas:
- auth with username/password
- admin page to make new ranking category/video idea
- on admin page, set vars like how many vids each person submits
- on users page, submit list of youtube video links
- preview of video thumbnail to make sure video is right
- on ranking page, embed youtube video and give scale to rank it
- ability to go back or go to next video, then submit them all
- on admin/final page, ability to see average scores for each video
- on admin page when creating playlist, selection for whether or not submitter's score is used for average
- stretch goal: button to download each video (would have to research youtube api)
